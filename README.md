## Overview

This project demonstrates how a simple link can be used to expose sensitive information such as the user's camera, IP address, and real-time location. It serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of digital security and user awareness when interacting with unknown or suspicious links online.

### Notable Features

- **Versatile Templates:** Choose from three distinct templates tailored to your needs.
- **Comprehensive Information:** Uncover essential details including IP address, location, device type, and browser.
- **Dual Tunneling:** Employ simultaneous double tunneling through Cloudflared and Loclx for enhanced security.
- **Customized Image Storage:** Decide where you'd like to store your images with the option to select a custom directory.
- **Effective Error Analysis:** Our built-in error diagnoser streamlines the troubleshooting process.
- **Flexible Configuration:** Enjoy improved flexibility with extensive support for specifying templates, tunneling options, and directory preferences.
